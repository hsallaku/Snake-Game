## Introduction

This is a simple Snake Game implemented in C#. The objective of the game is to control a snake to move and eat food that randomly appear on the screen. The more food the snake eats, the longer it gets. The game ends when the snake hits the screen boundary or itself.

## Technologies

The project is created with:
* C# 11.0
* .NET 7.0
* Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)

## Setup

1) To play this game, clone it locally and then run it using a .NET-compatible IDE like Visual Studio:
https://github.com/hsallaku/Snake-Game.git
2) Right click on any .cs file and click debug.
3) Follow the instructions on the pop-up window and try the game.

## How to Play
Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the direction of the snake.
The snake will move in the direction of the arrow key pressed.
Eat the food (symbolized as a "*") that appears randomly on the screen to gain points and increase the length of the snake.
Avoid hitting the screen boundary or the snake's own body.
Try to achieve your highest score!
